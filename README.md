## Hello, and welcome to `RedHead`!

# Who we are.

At RedHead, we are a passionate group dedicated to creating free and open-source (FOSS) computer software. Our mission is simple: to listen to the community and build software that truly meets their needs. Unlike most companies, we prioritize the voices of the people, placing their input at the heart of everything we do. We believe in the power of collaboration, transparency, and giving everyone the tools they need without barriers.

We are committed to respecting privacy, empowering users, and ensuring our work remains open for everyone to use, improve, and share.

# Our history.

We are a group with a story of resilience and reinvention. Founded in 2015 as a comic book business, we evolved into a game development studio. Between 2019 and 2020, we worked passionately to recreate the 1999 PlayStation classic "Vib-Ribbon" as an open-source project. Despite the project not reaching its goal and RedHead going out of business, our spirit never wavered.

In 2024, RedHead made its comeback, and with it, a renewed purpose. Today, we focus on creating free and open-source computer software, dedicated to the people. We believe in listening to the communityâ€”their needs and wants are the foundation of our work. Unlike many companies, we see privacy and security as fundamental rights. We promise to never log, track, or spy on anyone. Instead, we respect and protect the privacy of everyone who interacts with our software.

Our mission is simple: earn trust by building solutions that genuinely address the community's needs. At RedHead, we develop with transparency, dedication, and a focus on empowering users through software that reflects their voice.

# Current Projects.

- UniFlash: A soon-to-be-released fork of WoeUSB-NG, UniFlash is designed to give users the freedom to flash any file they want onto USBs or DVDs/Discs. Whether it's a `.bin` file, `.img`, `.iso`, or even something unconventional like a `.png`, UniFlash makes it possible.

- EFIGuard: EFIGuard is a protective tool for Windows 10 and 11 that allows users to spoof EFI files and information to safeguard the real EFI files from malicious content, such as malware. If a program attempts to modify the spoofed EFI files, EFIGuard force-closes the intruding program and notifies the user about the modification attempt, including details about the offending program's location. As of right now, this program is still in a soon-to-be-released state and is in it's very early stages of development.
